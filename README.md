# Chess

This is a command-line chess game written entirely in Ruby and using RSpec for
testing. It is the final project for the Ruby section of The Odin Project
curriculum. The project page is [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-ruby-final-project).

## Assignment
1. **Build a command line Chess game where two players can play against each
other.**
2. The game should be properly constrained – it should prevent players from
making illegal moves and declare check or check mate in the correct situations.
3. Make it so you can save the board at any time (remember how to serialize?)
4. Write tests for the important parts. You don’t need to TDD it (unless you
want to), but be sure to use RSpec tests for anything that you find yourself
typing into the command line repeatedly.
5. Do your best to keep your classes modular and clean and your methods doing
only one thing each. This is the largest program that you’ve written, so you’ll
definitely start to see the benefits of good organization (and testing) when
you start running into bugs.
6. Unfamiliar with Chess? Check out some of the additional resources to help
you get your bearings.
7. Have fun! Check out the [unicode characters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_symbols_in_Unicode) for a little spice for your
gameboard.
8. (Optional extension) Build a very simple AI computer player (perhaps who
does a random legal move)
